# Ticketing Platform — Microservices-Based E-Commerce System

A **scalable**, **cloud-native** ticketing and e-commerce system built with a **production-ready microservices architecture**.  
This platform uses **event-driven design**, **secure authentication**, and **CI/CD workflows** - all running in a fully containerized **Kubernetes** environment.  
It demonstrates how real-world systems are structured using **microservices**, **asynchronous communication**, and modern DevOps practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- 🌐 **Frontend**: SSR React app built with **Next.js**, optimized for SEO and performance.  
- ⚙️ **Microservices**: Each domain (auth, tickets, orders, payments, etc.) is a standalone **Node.js + Express** service.  
- 📡 **Event Bus**: High-speed, real-time communication via **NATS Streaming** using publish/subscribe architecture.  
- 📦 **Shared Code**: Reusable logic and TypeScript types extracted into a custom **NPM package** (`@michaelil/common`).  
- 🔐 **Authentication**: Stateless, JWT-based authentication applied across services for secure API access.  
- 🧩 **Data Layer**: Each service uses its own **MongoDB** or **Redis** instance, based on its specific domain needs.  
- 🐳 **Dockerized**: Every component runs in a **Docker container**, ready for CI/CD and consistent local dev.  
- ☸️ **Kubernetes**: Full orchestration with **Kubernetes**, including live-reloading and deployment via **Skaffold**.

## 📦 Services (So Far...)

- `auth` – Handles signup, signin, signout, and JWT validation
- `client` – The frontend React/Next.js application
- `common` – Shared reusable logic and type-safe utilities across services
- `infra` – Kubernetes and deployment configuration (ingress, NATS, MongoDB, etc.)

## 🧪 Testing

Currently, tests are implemented in the `auth` service only.

To run the tests, navigate to the `auth` folder and execute:

```bash
cd auth
npm run test
```

# 🧰 Prerequisites & Running Locally

To run the project locally, you’ll need:

- ✅ Docker Desktop
- ✅ Kubernetes enabled in Docker
- ✅ Skaffold installed ([Installation Guide](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/))

---

## ▶️ Start the Application

Navigate to the root of the project and run:

```bash
skaffold dev
```

### This will:

Build all microservices

Start them inside Kubernetes

Expose the app via ingress-nginx (usually at http://ticketing.dev)

🧾 Update Your Hosts File
Make sure your /etc/hosts file includes:

```bash
127.0.0.1 ticketing.dev
```

🔐 Environment & Secrets
Secrets are managed manually using Kubernetes secrets. Before starting, you’ll need to create the JWT secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_KEY=your_jwt_key_here
```
